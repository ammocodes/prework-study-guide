# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted to learn what the journey of a real world project is and experience the day to day jobs and tasks of web developer.

This project was built with the intention to practice web development.

By working on this project - I had the ability to try out my new found skills and collect notes for topics that I have struggled with.

Whilst using HTML, CSS, JS, I learned how to write, test and debug code.
